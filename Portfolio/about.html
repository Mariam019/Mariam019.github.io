            <h3>My Journey</h3>
         </div>
         <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>I am Mariam Zaoui, and I have a strong academic foundation and practical experience in the fields of Information Systems, 
            Digital Transformation, Web Development, and Data Analytics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Digital
            Transformation, where I learned key concepts such as database management, software engineering, and web development. 
            During my studies, I developed a keen interest in combining technical skills with problem-solving to create impactful solutions.
            Currently, I am pursuing courses in data analytics, with a focus on tools like SQL, and data visualization, which 
            complements my knowledge in web development. Through various academic projects and an internship, I have honed my web development 
            skills, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Laravel, and PHP, building responsive websites, and optimizing user 
            experiences. Additionally, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my data analytics knowledge in real-world scenarios, analyzing data sets,
            creating visualizations, and deriving actionable insights that help organizations make data-driven decisions. I have also completed 
            professional certificates, such as the Professional Foundations Certificate from ALX and the Introduction to Python course from 
            DataCamp, which have further enriched my understanding of programming, algorithms, and data manipulation. I am passionate about 
            leveraging technology to drive innovation and efficiency, and I am constantly looking to enhance my skills to stay ahead of industry
            trends. My experiences and continuous learning have shaped me into a motivated and adaptable individual, eager to contribute my 
            expertise in both web development and data analytics to impactful projects.</p>

        <h3>My ALX Learning Journey</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
        <p>
            During my time in the ALX program, I embarked on a transformative learning journey that helped me expand both my technical and 
            personal growth. The program provided me with a solid foundation in areas like problem-solving, teamwork, and technical expertise 
            in fields such as data analytics and software engineering. It introduced me to industry-standard tools and best practices that have
             been vital in shaping my approach to both work and learning.<br>

            Through the various challenges and hands-on projects, I had the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios.
             I gained practical experience in areas like database management, data analysis, and working with modern frameworks and 
             technologies. The ALX program taught me to approach problems methodically, ensuring my solutions are not only effective but also 
             scalable and maintainable.<br>

            I also had the opportunity to develop my soft skills. Working on group projects, I learned the importance of collaboration, 
            communication, and adapting to diverse perspectives and approaches. The program's rigorous structure helped me hone my time 
            management skills and fostered a sense of responsibility for my work.<br>

            One of the highlights of my ALX experience was completing projects that mirrored real-world tasks, which allowed me to bridge the 
            gap between classroom learning and practical application. This experience gave me the confidence to tackle challenging tasks and 
            the adaptability to thrive in dynamic work environments.<br>

            The ALX program has undoubtedly shaped me into a motivated, adaptable, and solution-driven individual, ready to take on new 
            challenges and contribute to meaningful projects in the fields of data analytics.
